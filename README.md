# rabbit-run-to-work
 Rabbit Run game features Fred the Rabbit, who wakes up late, and has to get to work before his boss. The player 'rolls' a die, and moves the number of steps returned. The player and the computer take turns - whoever reaches the finish line first, wins.

 I often have to wake up very early and 'punch in' at my workplace before my start time. I often feel rushed like Fred to quickly get ready, fight through traffic, and find a good parking spot to make it to work and not be late.

 I created Fred and the computer player as an instance of my 'Player' class, which includes a 'left' property to move the divs that represent the characters across the screen. 
 
 Callback functions were used for the game logic, as well as animations to make it look more game-like, and not just shapes moving across the page.

 Upcoming features would be surprise events, which would affect the players' distance across the screen, depending on if the event is one of good luck or bad luck. For example, player spilled their coffee and has to 'stop to pick up coffee' which sets back their distance.
